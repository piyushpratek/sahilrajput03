## Pushing archLinux.iso to a usb:

```
dd: disk dump (people also call it as disk destroyer, coz if not used correct drive it'll destroy the target drive).
man dd: to read its documentation.


dd if=Downloads/archlinux_64.iso of=/dev/sdb
# if=inputFile, of=ouputFile.
# be careful that your of (output file) i.e., if its gonna be extremely right device you want the iso file's data to be dumped off.
```

## Become root user

`sudo su`

## Why prefer pacman ?

Bcoz if you ever run `pacman -Syu` then all your packages installed via pacman will be updated.

## Installed chromium

```
sudo pacman -S chromium
```

If you get some error then you can use `sudo pacman -Syu` to upgrade the system and probably the problem will be fixed as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67552506/10012446) helped me. 


## Update system

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Installed code-server via below commands

src: 

```
# Install code-server from the AUR with plain makepkg.
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/code-server.git
cd code-server
makepkg -si
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

## setting up ssh

```
sudo pacman -S openssh

# check the status:
sudo systemctl status sshd

#start service if above command shows ``inactive``
sudo systemctl start sshd

# now check again the status and it should be active for sure.

# to stop ssh server:
sudo systemctl stop sshd
```
