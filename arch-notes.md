## Recursiveness in ls or tree

```
ls -R -I node_modules* -I debug* -I build* -I deps*
# Prints everything recursively (-R) and ignored patters like node_modules, build, deps. Yikes!!

tree -I 'arch_os|target|rustlings|target|node_modules'
# PRints everything recursively, src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/47806/504112
```

## Installed docker, docker-compose in archos

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose

sudo systemctl enable docker.service #So that docker automatically starts on system boot.

# PLEASE REBOOT(reboot means reboot and not just logout and login) THE SYSTEM ONCE PLEASE TO BE ABLE TO GET DOCKER FUNCTIONING. src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55911400/10012446

# Test if docker is running GOOD via:
sudo systemctl status docker
# or
docker info # OR
docker ps -aux

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
#    ^^^^^ This might be needed if you get some permission issue for socket i.e., ```/var/run/docker.sock```

## Switching to different user:

```bash
src: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PostgreSQL

# If you have sudo and are in sudoers:
$ sudo -iu someUser
echo $USER                        #Prints currently logged in user.


# Otherwise using su:
$ su    #Enter the root's password, then you'll be logged in as root user(i.e., #)
# su -l someUser
echo $USER                        #Prints currently logged in user.

```
sudo pacman -S watchexec
# Usage: watchexec -c ./fly.sh    # -c is option for clearning screen on each run.
```

FYI: The problem with `nodmeon -x "bash $@"` was that it seemed to supress some message like when have a script like:

```bash
read -p "Enter your name" name # with nodemon it does print ""Enter your name"" which get printed when you run wihtout nodemon. So watchexec rocks!
echo $name
```

## Define variables in arch-os

sudo vim /etc/environment
# Now add some value pairs, i.e., v1=value1 one in each line and you would be able to test them i.e., `echo $v1` once after logout/login event.

## Pushing archLinux.iso to a usb:

man dd: to read its documentation.


dd if=Downloads/archlinux_64.iso of=/dev/sdb
# if=inputFile, of=ouputFile.
# be careful that your of (output file) i.e., if its gonna be extremely right device you want the iso file's data to be dumped off.
```

## Become root user

`sudo su`

## Why prefer pacman ?

Bcoz if you ever run `pacman -Syu` then all your packages installed via pacman will be updated.

## Installed chromium

```
sudo pacman -S chromium
```

If you get some error then you can use `sudo pacman -Syu` to upgrade the system and probably the problem will be fixed as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67552506/10012446) helped me. 


## Update system

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Installed code-server via below commands

src: 

```
# Install code-server from the AUR with plain makepkg.
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/code-server.git
cd code-server
makepkg -si
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

## setting up ssh

```
sudo pacman -S openssh

# check the status:
sudo systemctl status sshd

#start service if above command shows ``inactive``
sudo systemctl start sshd

# now check again the status and it should be active for sure.
