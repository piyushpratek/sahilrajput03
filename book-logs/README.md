## Reading Techniques and Approaches

***How can one read fast ?***
- Listen to book while reading (Google Play Books and [Amazong Kindle - Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en_IN&gl=US)*). I am talking about Amazon Kindle device and sadly Amazon Kindle android app doesn't have this feature though)
- While sending books to Google Play Books you must first convert if pdf to epub (or mobi to epup) so that you can use have text-reflow and "Read aloud" feature available in there.
- Reading Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) software like Amazon Kindle Android app support this and for desktop you can use amazing [ShiftReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiftreader-speed-read-th/clcbpepidaphghjahkionjhffkolcpek?hl=en) as chrome extension, it really amazing!
- Use [Kindle Web](https://read.amazon.com/kindle-library), though it doesn't support hear to text or RSVP feature but interface is good.
- See you [Play Books in desktop](https://play.google.com/books) as well. It doesn't support hear to text or RSVP feature yet.
