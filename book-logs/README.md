- Listen to book while reading (Google Play Books and Amazong Kindle*)
- Reading Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) software like Amazon Kindle Android app support this and for desktop you can use amazing [ShiftReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiftreader-speed-read-th/clcbpepidaphghjahkionjhffkolcpek?hl=en) as chrome extension, it really amazing!
