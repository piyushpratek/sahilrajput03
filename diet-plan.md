#### Making CHAWMIN

- • ----- WHATS CHAWMIN and NOODLES?? : Noodles is basically a type of food that is made from dough, while chow-mein is a dish made with noodles. Actually, chow mein is coined from two words 'chow' which means fried, and 'mein' refers to noodles. So the moral of the story is all chow mein are noodles, but all noodles are not chow mein.
- PREREQUISITES: Note: If the noodles are too long then  break it into half .. and still they'll le large enough to be enjoyed.
- PROCEDURE:
- - Put noodles in boiling water(least enough water so noodles are immersed into) and boil for exactly 4 minutes and boil on medium flame.
- - Now put out boiled noodles and keep them in big bowl/plate and add two full tbsp of oil/ghee into it and mix well the oil using two chop sticks/ fork. This makes sure that noodles wont stick to each other.
- - Now put 2 tbsp of oil/ghee in a pan and boil it and add all the nice small chopped veggies and cook for 3-4 min on mid flame and dont overcook else the texture of veggies would get bad and wont be enjoyable when served.
- - Now add the noodles into pan, keep flame at medium. Use two chop sticks/fork to mix noodles and maggi masal/chingsFriedRiceMasala/chingsChawMasala {do add few drops of water on top of masala so it mix easily} and cook for 3-4 more mins. NOW ITS READY TO BE SERVED!!.; 
- - Recepie: ICE-CREAM RANVEER KITCHEN :: (only single freeze)::
- Prerequisites:
- ->Amul 250ml whipping cream( blue color: Rs. 63, but check if you can get  red coloured packing coz thats actually heavy whipping cream and works good for icecream and cakes as well).
- ->Milk powder
- ->Milk - 300ml (approx: 2 x 140ml cups)
- -> Sugar
- Procedure::
- Take 2 cups of milk powder(300ml) and add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to it. This helps in fluffiness. Keep this mixture aside.
- Now take 140ml(1 small cup) crystal sugar and 140ml(1 small cup) milk{prefer the red packet of milk of possible} and put it on flame and keep boiling it till it gets light stickyness in it. Now add mixture 1 into this. And boil for 5-10 more minutes and turn off the flame. NOTE: Thok k nhi pakana hai~ Ranveer Kitchen. So our condensed milk is ready!.
- Now take chilled cream(amul whipping cream Rs.63 - 250ml) and chilled container(say keep blender(its container as well)/mixer container in the fridger for atleast 2 hrs before use) and add 1 ICE CREAM to it as well. You need to whip it now for approx 8-10 minutes till you get sharp spikes of our whipped cream. NOTE: If you over do it then it'll turn itself into butter and it would be of no use.., so the safer the merrier.
