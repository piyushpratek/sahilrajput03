#### Getting project [src](https://youtu.be/p76zsTDqahM)

- Keep expectations low and understanding that compounding works.
- You have to raise to 150$/hr. Don't forget the power of compounding bcoz it always happens.
- You won't get a project until you apply to a 100 @upwork. Some people apply to three projects and get no response then they just shut off. Apply the maths that I'm going to get 1% of the projects I apply to. Take a crack at 100, 5 will reply and out of which 1 will convert because if someone is replying that doesn't mean one will give you the project.
- Have a humble cover letter. I am learning and I'm trying to get better. Humility works much much better and lands you the first project.
- 99% of people in India don't believe in the freelancing, they like the idea but they don't believe that its possible to run a career on it.

#### Client Handling (single big mistake that pisses the client)

A client would love to work with if you would have a constant conversative (constant here means that conversing each day otherwise the client would think that freelancer is fraud and simply stolen the money). ~ Varun Mayya
