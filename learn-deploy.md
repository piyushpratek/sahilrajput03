# Deployment

## Github Pages

Add below `A records` for your custom domain dns setting in your domain provider panel.

```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

## Heroku

Why heroku?

Heroku provides https enabled backend server in no time which is too good for no-budget apps testing.

You can serve a nested folder project in heroku using a custom `build-pack` as well. Find it working @ [video-chat-app-webrtc](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/video-chat-app-webrtc/tree/hash-router#guide-to-publish-a-nested-project-folder-serving-to-heroku)

Heroku has database as a service as well. [Check here](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).

See my command list @ [Gist](https://gist.github.com/sahilrajput03/c44778f281e5f9856827e7c0f264ffa5).
