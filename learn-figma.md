  **1st week of march**:

- You can press and hold `alt` key while hovering over _text size_ numbers in the _Design tab_ to get a nice text size dragger to change the text size simply via mouse.

- Select **_frame tool_** (hotkey `F`) and you can now get a base frame of any device say for:

  - **_Phones_** you can select from _Android Large_, _Android Small_, _iPhone8_ (8 Plus, SE, 13mini, 13, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max)
  - **_Tablet_** you can select from _Surface Pro 8_, _iPad mini 8.3_, _iPad Pro 11"_ or _iPad Pro 12.9"_
  - **_Desktop_** you can select from _MacBook Pro 14"_, _MacBook Pro 16"_, _Desktop_ or _iMac_
  - **_Presentation_** you can select from _Slide 16:9_ (1920x1080) or _Slide 4:3_ (1024x768)

- **Fill**:

  - We can add multiple layers of **_Fill_** in a shape by clicking the `+` sign on next to **_Fill_** menu under _Design_ tab.
  - We can choose from fill types as _Solid_, _Linear_, _Radial_, _Angular_, _Diamond_ or _Image_.
  - Tip: In _Liner_ type, you have control of two types of opacity i.e., transparency of each color you have, and second is the overall transparency of the whole(you can set this by setting value in the text with % sign before the eye icon).
  - Tip: We can add multiple solid, gradient or radial fills here, that could be interesting though.

- Layers? In the left bar i.e., **_Layers_** menu, object on the very top will show up on the very top in the cavase as well. THATS ALL!
- Layers: You can select **_multiple_** entities and move them at the top or bottom very easily from the left bar, i.e., **_Layers_** menu directly.
- Layers: It is very intutive to anybody else if you arrange the entites in the **_Layers_** menu according to the entity flow in the canvas. ALSO, instructs the very fundamental base of the distribution of entities as well. ~Kevin.
- When you select text tool, always drag and draw the text box first so your text reflow is bounded to that area only.
- Typography choice - Font: Roboto, Font Size: 72, Font style: Black (or say Bold, although Black is little better IMO)
- You can move around using hand tool but the fastest way is to use hold <spacebar> and now you can drag using mouse to move the page for the time.
- You can align a group of items together by selecting (more than one elements) and choosing one of the styles of bars that are showing up just below the **_Design menu_** on the right bar.
- **_Lock_** layer: When you want that you don't accidentally select and move any element (say many big entities on the canvas), you can lock them by clicking the lock icon (OR `ctrl+shift+l`) in the left bar under **_Layers_** menu.
- `Shift` key can be used to select multiple elements, tip: say when dran area with move tool you get bunch of elements selected and then you can use `shift` key to toggle unselect any element as well. WhoaaAA!!
- You can **_group_** a number of entities together by selecting them (more than one elements) and pressing `ctrl+g` and now you can drag them as a single entity i.e., group only.
- WHEN GROUPED, you can still individually alter each elements properties, so need to ungroup if you want to play with any individual entity inside it.
- You can **_ungroup_** a group by selecting it and pressing `ctrl+shift+g`.
- You can use copy cursor to create copy of an element by pressing and holding `alt` key, you can visually see the cursor changing to copy cursor(two cursors) as well. Thats handy way to check with the functionality though.
- You can double click the text box **_edge_** to shrink the text box to the minimum it can go!
- You can rotate any entity by selecting it and placing the cursor outside the entity till you get the nice arc shaped cursor, and then you can click and drag to rotate the entity as per wish.
- To make a box with border only (i.e, no fill) then you can simply delete all your **_Fill_** layers from the right bar under **_Fill_** menu and add a stroke instead of your choice for your shape.
- Figma tracks all the colors that you have used so far in your file, you can see them under **_Document colors_** in all your color pickers (i.e., say, Fill or Stroke or others).
- You can move any entity up/down in the z-index by using `ctrl+[` (move backward/downward) or `ctrl+]` (move forward/upward), to see the effects notice changes in the left bar under the **_Layers_** menu.
- SUPER:TIP - You can use `ctrl+shift+[` (move to bottom) or `ctrl+shift+]` (move to top) to move. YO!
- You can choose the _Letter Case_ of text box (i.e., say if you want text to be uppercase only), you can do that by selecting your text box then navigating to **_Text_** menu then clicking the `...` button (in the end of the menu) and under the **_Letter Case_** section we can choose our required case.
- To make sharp corners of a rectangle to rounded, you can do that by clicking and dragging any of the tiny blue circles inside of each corner of the rectangle shape. WARN: In case you don't see the tiny blue circles around each of the corner, then probably you are not zoomed enough OR possibly your cursor is not inside of the rectange. ~thanks to kevin.
- While you need to align multiple entities, you can choose to _Align left/right/top/bottom_ **_OR_** _Align horizontal/vertical centers_.
- When you want to use any image as a fill for the text, you can right click the text entity and right-click to choose **_Use as Mask_ (`ctrl+alt+m`)** option. Now you can put any image by dragging the image over it and it'll simply fill it. You can go to **_Fill_** menu in the right bar and choose the Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, Temperature, Tint, Highlight of image.
- When you need to scale (make bigger) multiple text blocks so that your your font size also scales accordingly, you must use **Scale tool** i.e, (hotkey: `k`) {instead of move tool} and then you may click and drag the corner boxes to scale.
- MAGIC: While you are in between of dragging your shapes when you're drawing them you press and hold hold `<space>` to actually move the shape without going distoring the shape that you have at the moment and after deciding the position you may rescale the shape as well. Magic isn't it?.
- Color picker: You can select any entity(shape or text) and then press `i` to launch the color picker on the fly to select the entity's fill color.

- _From Figma components: the basics to creating roubs components_:

- _Auto layout_ feature:

  - An _Auto layout_ entity in the _layers menu_ has a icon like two rectangles stacked vertically or horizontally depending on the direction you choose for the _Auto layout_.
  - Select one or more entites and press `shift+a` to enable _Auto layout_ menu in the right bar under Design menu.
  - _Auto layout_: You can see the _Auto layout_ option in the right bar under _Design menu_ ONLY when you have selected TWO OR MORE entities. (TIP: You can still enable _Autolayout_ for single entity as well by using shortcut `shift+a`, thanks to Kevin).
  - _Auto layout_ enables you to specify the positioning of one entity inside other entity(i.e., horizontally alignment and vertical alignment), you can do that by _Choosing Alignment and Padding_ option which is the last icon in the _Autolayout_ menu.
  - A _Auto layout_ is almost like a flexbox, i.e., it can have direction horizontal or vertical. You may change the the direction by the two arrows in the _Auto layout_ menu.
  - IMPORTANT TIP: in your _Auto layout_, say you want a group of items to be be act as a single entity then you can simply use the group option (`ctrl+g`) to group a list of items so that when you alter the attributes in your _Auto layout_ that has your group in it will behave as a single fixed entity. Yo! Thanks to kevin!
  - You may set the margins b/w items in autolayout items by adjusting *Spacing between items* option in the *Auto layout* menu.

- Component Properties (Make an entity component with `ctrl+alt+k` ):

  - The Component entities appear is a solid diamond shaped icon whereas the instances(copies) if any appear as outlined diamond icon in the layers menu in the left bar.
  - _Inherited attributes_ can be: text content, text color, border radius, text style, text font, fill color, and many more!!
  - If you create multiple copies of a component and change the properties(say inherit attributes) of the _Main component_ then all other copies will get same effect instantly. IMPORTANT: Only properties which you altered manually in the copied components will NOT BE affected when you change the _Main component_.
  - TIP: _Main component_ is the one from which you made other copies.
  - You can refer(go) to master component of any copied component by right-clicking it and select _Go to main component_.
  - You can right-click any copy(instance) of the main component by right-clicking it and select _Detach Instance_ option
  - In a copy(instance) of the main component, you can right-click and us _Reset all overrides_ to reset all changes w.r.t to main component.
  - Top reason to create a component is that when we need our some other copied enties to inherit properties from the main entity(main component) along with the facility of still be able to modify the attributes of each copy of entity, yo!
  - TIP: You can created nested level of components as well:: thanks to Kevin. The way its helpful is that, say you have Componnent C1 and we make a copy of it and make that itself a component say C2. Now when we make a copy of C2 entity say E3 we see that if we change attrib of C1, it reflects in both C1 and E3. FUN FACT: When we change attrib of C2 the proeprties of E3 will be changed as well. So this illustrates properties linked in a nested manner with the help of component feature we have applied to C1 and C2 (and key point is that C2 is a copy of C1 component so its also linked to C1 and E3 inherits from C2 altogether).
  - THE OTHER BIG REASON TO CREATE COMPONENTS: You can import any component into any frame or any other page or other frame (coz our components are available as assets in whole file) by selecting _Assets_ tab in the left bar, and then simply drag and drop any of the component you want.
  - After importing a component as asset in any frame/other page, we can change the component very simply by clicking the drop down menu and choose from the other available options from there. YO!
  - The main component can be very powerfully used in a way like: You may add tons of items in it {as its the base component for all the other components that you are making} and hide/show them accordingly in the instances of the main component so that you just have to maintain one single main component and don't redraw any new entity in any of the instances. THE BIG REASON we try not to add more entities to any instance of the main component is bcoz we simply cannot unless we detach the instance from its main component(by righ-clicking and choose _Detach_ option and it would just take away all the benefits we intended to leverage from the component's inheritance properties say padding, margins, widths, shadows, text fonts, etc). Thanks to Kevin.

- Color Style:

  - You can create a _Color Style_ simly by selecting a color first in _Fill_ and then open the _Style menu_ (the for small squares stacked icon) and then press the `+` icon and type the name for the color style you want to give it.
  - You can change any existing color by right clicking on the color in the _Color Styles_ section and simply choosing a new color now.

- Frames:

  - A frame in the _layer menu_ has an icon like #
  - You can rename a frame as well as suited to what describes your current frame.
  - We can change the size of the frame by first selecting the frame via clicking on the frame name on top-left and then via the highlighted edges we can resize the frame easily.

- Pages:

  - You can rename the page name as well, by double clicking the page name.

- Others:
  - You can duplicate a layer by selecting it and the layer first and then using `ctrl+d` shortcut.
  - _Auto layout_ vs. _Grouping_: Auto layout works like a group though but with additional capability like {internal margin to each other can be set at once}, or we can center content in a parent container via both horizontally or vertically by the settings in the _Auto layout_ menu, whereas in a group feature there's no such thing.

## Zoom

- You can zoom in/out/100% with `+`,`-` and `ctrl+0`.
- **You can invert the zoom scroll direction(which is better IMO) by** - _Preferences > Invert zoom directions_.
- **You can set the zoom level in figma from the right top corner.**
- **Zoom**: Hold down `ctrl` key to enable zoom with mouse scroll. NOTE: pgdown scroll causes to zoom out, **pageup** scroll causes to **`ZOOM-IN`** in the canvas.
- **Zoom to select region**: First press and hold `z` and then hold mouse make region to zoom into.

## Exporting elements

- **Right click an element and select "copy as png" option to export/copy any particular object in figma. TIP: You can use `paste_png` in linux cli to paste the copied png image then.**
- Select an element and go to `Design tab` in the right bar of the desktop and select `Export` option to be able to export it into one of _png_, _jpg_, _svg_ and _pdf_ format.

## Resize

While holding and dragging edges/corner_squares of the element, you can -

- **resize freely**: no-modifier
- **resize keeping aspect-ratio**: `shift`
- **resize keeping aspect-ratio and STAY in place**: `shift+alt`

**Resources for images, gifs, svgs ?**: [Click here](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/cssDesignTrail/blob/master/README.md#images-free-images-random-image-place-holderimage)

**Making a obs camera mark [here](https://youtu.be/_sqLa0LTloM).**

**You can save a complete figma file locally via `File > Save local copy...` option easily.**

_My learning Prototyping File @ figma_: [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/P1DNXwjD4TcDV6pNXqvoOn/Learn-prototyping?node-id=4%3A55)

**Copy objects**: Hold `alt` and drag elements to create copies.

\*\*You can crop the object sizes by holding `alt` key, and using edge points to crop proportioal to ?????

**Pages concept**: It is an amazing concept to keep designs isloated in each page, thus you can do a large number of separate design works in a single file of figma. Yo!

**Quick actions**: `ctrl+/`

**Presentation Mode(preview mode, show/hide UI)**: `ctrl+\`

**Undo/Redo/copy/cut/selectAll**: Use `ctrl+z`/`ctrl+y`/`ctrl+c`/`ctrl+x`/`ctrl+a`.

**Lock a object/objects to fix them and disable selection of them**: Select object/objects and use `ctrl+shift+l` to toggle lock/unlock. BETTER WAY IS TO USE lock icon in the **_Layers section_**.

**Show help shortcuts for tools**: `Ctrl+shift+?` (or use the bottom right `?` button and select `Keyboard Shortcuts`) and switch to `Tools` tab to view the tools shortcuts. [List of all hotkeys](https://shortcuts.design/tools/toolspage-figma/).

**Hand tool - BEST WAY TO MOVE AROUND PAGE**: Hold down `space` key to activate hand tool temporarily and move the page with mouse simply.

**Move objects horizontally or vertically**: Hold down `shift` key and drag them.

**PROPORTIONALLY SCALING:: Create squares or perfect circles or aligned line or aligned arros using** _rectange tool_ or _ellipse tool_ or _line_ or _arrow_: Choose _rectange tool_ with `r` or _ellipse_ with `o` and then hold down `shift` key and now you can draw _square_ or _perfect_ circle now.

**Set opacity of any object**: Select object and press `1` for 10%, `2` for 20% so on.. and `0` for 100%. TIP: To set opacity to 0%, press `00`

**Copy selected object/objects as PNG**: `Ctrl+shift+c`

## Prototyping

Official getting started [post of prototyping in figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma) is good though.

**Tips:**

**_Component_**:

- To be able to have the right dot for creating transitions for the prototyping, you must first select all the objects and use `ctrl+alt+k` to create a single component of those items which then just stick together. Now your transition would work good! 💯
- IMPORTANT: You must convert a object to a component first to be able to get prototyping circle connector. You can do it via right clicking and select **_Create Component_** option or simply use `ctrl+shift+k`.
- You can use `r` in prototyping to restart the prototype(in case of hovering you don't need to restart prototype though coz unhovering it causes to undo the effect instantly).
- Use `right mouse click` to shown options in prototype display tab.
- Toggle between prototype mode and design mode using hotkey `shift+e` or simply choose from the right **_Prototype_** or **_Design_** tab in the right hand side bar.
- In the **_prototype tab_**, you can select one of the interactions with mouse to open its **_interaction details_** or you can simply click the prototype arrows to open it directly.
