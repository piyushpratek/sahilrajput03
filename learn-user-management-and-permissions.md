# 1: file/directory significance.
# 234: read write execution permission for the user owner of the file.
# 567: read write execution permission for the user owner's group of the file.
# 890: read write execution permission for all other users.


# user of the file:
$ chmod +rwx filename

# all the users in the group of the
chmod g+w filename
chmod g-wx filename

# others
chmod o+w filename
chmod o-rwx foldername

# Using permission numbers
# 0 = ---
# 1 = --x
# 2 = -w-
# 3 = -wx
# 4 = r-
# 5 = r-x
# 6 = rw-
# 7 = rwx

chmod 777 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for everyone.
chmod 700 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for the user only.
chmod 327 foldername will give write and execute (3) permission for the user, w (2) for the group, and read, write, and execute for the users.

ps -u array
ps -u root


##### Create user
sudo useradd username
# To create appropriate home directory for the user as well(by default its home directory for a new user is not created). Fyi: This creates a `username` directory as well @ path: /home/username
sudo useradd -m username


# Change password of a user
sudo passwd username

# Delete user
sudo userdel username
```
