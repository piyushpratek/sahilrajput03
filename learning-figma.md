**1st week of march**:

- Select **_frame tool_** (hotkey `F`) and you can now get a base frame of any device say for:
  - **_Phones_** you can select from _Android Large_, _Android Small_, _iPhone8_ (8 Plus, SE, 13mini, 13, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max)
  - **_Tablet_** you can select from _Surface Pro 8_, _iPad mini 8.3_, _iPad Pro 11"_ or _iPad Pro 12.9"_
  - **_Desktop_** you can select from _MacBook Pro 14"_, _MacBook Pro 16"_, _Desktop_ or _iMac_
  - **_Presentation_** you can select from _Slide 16:9_ (1920x1080) or _Slide 4:3_ (1024x768)

- **Fill**:
  - We can add multiple layers of ***Fill*** in a shape by clicking the `+` sign on next to ***Fill*** menu under _Design_ tab.
  - We can choose from fill types as _Solid_, _Linear_, _Radial_, _Angular_, _Diamond_ or _Image_.
  - Tip: In _Liner_ type, you have control of two types of opacity i.e., transparency of each color you have, and second is the overall transparency of the whole(you can set this by setting value in the text with % sign before the eye icon).
  - Tip: We can add multiple solid, gradient or radial fills here, that could be interesting though.

- Layers? In the left bar i.e., **_Layers_** menu, object on the very top will show up on the very top in the cavase as well. THATS ALL!
- Layers: You can select **_multiple_** entities and move them at the top or bottom very easily from the left bar, i.e., **_Layers_** menu directly.
- Layers: It is very intutive to anybody else if you arrange the entites in the **_Layers_** menu according to the entity flow in the canvas. ALSO, instructs the very fundamental base of the distribution of entities as well. ~Kevin.
- When you select text tool, always drag and draw the text box first so your text reflow is bounded to that area only.
- Typography choice - Font: Roboto, Font Size: 72, Font style: Black (or say Bold, although Black is little better IMO)
- You can move around using hand tool but the fastest way is to use hold <spacebar> and now you can drag using mouse to move the page for the time.
- You can align a group of items together by selecting (more than one elements) and choosing one of the styles of bars that are showing up just below the **_Design menu_** on the right bar.
- **_Lock_** layer: When you want that you don't accidentally select and move any element (say many big entities on the canvas), you can lock them by clicking the lock icon in the left bar under **_Layers_** menu.
- `Shift` key can be used to select multiple elements, tip: say when dran area with move tool you get bunch of elements selected and then you can use `shift` key to toggle unselect any element as well. WhoaaAA!!
- You can **_group_** a number of entities together by selecting them (more than one elements) and pressing `ctrl+g` and now you can drag them as a single entity i.e., group only.
- You can **_ungroup_** a group by selecting it and pressing `ctrl+shift+g`.
- You can use copy cursor to create copy of an element by pressing and holding `alt` key, you can visually see the cursor changing to copy cursor(two cursors) as well. Thats handy way to check with the functionality though.
- You can double click the text box **_edge_** to shrink the text box to the minimum it can go!
- You can rotate any entity by selecting it and placing the cursor outside the entity till you get the nice arc shaped cursor, and then you can click and drag to rotate the entity as per wish.
- To make a box with border only (i.e, no fill) then you can simply delete all your **_Fill_** layers from the right bar under **_Fill_** menu and add a stroke instead of your choice for your shape.
- Figma tracks all the colors that you have used so far in your file, you can see them under **_Document colors_** in all your color pickers (i.e., say, Fill or Stroke or others).
- You can move any entity up/down in the z-index by using `ctrl+[` or `ctrl+]`, to see the effects notice changes in the left bar under the **_Layers_** menu.
- You can choose the _Letter Case_ of text box (i.e., say if you want text to be uppercase only), you can do that by selecting your text box then navigating to **_Text_** menu then clicking the `...`  button (in the end of the menu) and under the **_Letter Case_** section we can choose our required case.
- To make sharp corners of a rectangle to rounded, you can do that by clicking and dragging any of the tiny blue circles inside of each corner of the rectangle shape. WARN: In case you don't see the tiny blue circles around each of the corner, then probably you are not zoomed enough OR possibly your cursor is not inside of the rectange. ~thanks to kevin.
- While you need to align multiple entities, you can choose to _Align left/right/top/bottom_ **_OR_** _Align horizontal/vertical centers_.
  

## Zoom

- You can zoom in/out/100% with `+`,`-` and `ctrl+0`.
- **You can invert the zoom scroll direction(which is better IMO) by** - *Preferences > Invert zoom directions*.
- **You can set the zoom level in figma from the right top corner.**
- **Zoom**: Hold down `ctrl` key to enable zoom with mouse scroll. NOTE: pgdown scroll causes to zoom out, **pageup** scroll causes to **`ZOOM-IN`** in the canvas.
- **Zoom to select region**: First press and hold `z` and then hold mouse make region to zoom into.

## Exporting elements

- **Right click an element and select "copy as png" option to export/copy any particular object in figma. TIP: You can use `paste_png` in linux cli to paste the copied png image then.**
- Select an element and go to `Design tab` in the right bar of the desktop and select `Export` option to be able to export it into one of _png_, _jpg_, _svg_ and _pdf_ format.

## Resize

While holding and dragging edges/corner_squares of the element, you can -

- **resize freely**: no-modifier
- **resize keeping aspect-ratio**: `shift`
- **resize keeping aspect-ratio and STAY in place**: `shift+alt`

**Making a obs camera mark [here](https://youtu.be/_sqLa0LTloM).**

**You can save a complete figma file locally via `File > Save local copy...` option easily.**

_My learning Prototyping File @ figma_: [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/P1DNXwjD4TcDV6pNXqvoOn/Learn-prototyping?node-id=4%3A55)

**Copy objects**: Hold `alt` and drag elements to create copies.

**You can crop the object sizes by holding `alt` key, and using edge points to crop proportioal to ?????

**Pages concept**: It is an amazing concept to keep designs isloated in each page, thus you can do a large number of separate design works in a single file of figma. Yo!

**Quick actions**: `ctrl+/`

**Presentation Mode(preview mode, show/hide UI)**: `ctrl+\`

**Undo/Redo/copy/cut/selectAll**: Use `ctrl+z`/`ctrl+y`/`ctrl+c`/`ctrl+x`/`ctrl+a`.

**Lock a object/objects to fix them and disable selection of them**: Select object/objects and use `ctrl+shift+l` to toggle lock/unlock. BETTER WAY IS TO USE lock icon in the ***Layers section***.

**Show help shortcuts for tools**: `Ctrl+shift+?` (or use the bottom right `?` button and select `Keyboard Shortcuts`) and switch to `Tools` tab to view the tools shortcuts. [List of all hotkeys](https://shortcuts.design/tools/toolspage-figma/).

**Hand tool - BEST WAY TO MOVE AROUND PAGE**: Hold down `space` key to activate hand tool temporarily and move the page with mouse simply.
  
**Move objects horizontally or vertically**: Hold down `shift` key and drag them.

**PROPORTIONALY SCALING:: Create squares or perfect circles or aligned line or aligned arros using** _rectange tool_ or _ellipse tool_ or _line_ or _arrow_: Choose *rectange tool* with `r` or *ellipse* with `o` and then hold down `shift` key and now you can draw _square_ or _perfect_ circle now.

**Set opacity of any object**: Select object and press `1` for 10%, `2` for 20% so on.. and `0` for 100%. TIP: To set opacity to 0%, press `00`

**Copy selected object/objects as PNG**: `Ctrl+shift+c`

## Prototyping

Official getting started [post of prototyping in figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma) is good though.

**Tips:**

- To be able to have the right dot for creating transitions for the prototyping, you must first select all the objects and use `ctrl+alt+k` to create a single component of those items which then just stick together. Now your transition would work good! ðŸ’¯

- IMPORTANT: You must convert a object to a component first to be able to get prototyping circle connector. You can do it via right clicking and select ***Create Component*** option or simply use `ctrl+shift+k`.

- You can use `r` in prototyping to restart the prototype(in case of hovering you don't need to restart prototype though coz unhovering it causes to undo the effect instantly).
- Use `right mouse click` to shown options in prototype display tab.

- Toggle between prototype mode and design mode using hotkey `shift+e` or simply choose from the right ***Prototype*** or ***Design*** tab in the right hand side bar.

- In the ***prototype tab***, you can select one of the interactions with mouse to open its ***interaction details*** or you can simply click the prototype arrows to open it directly.
