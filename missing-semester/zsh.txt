You are seeing this message because you have no zsh startup files
(the files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, .zlogin in the directory
~).  This function can help you with a few settings that should
make your use of the shell easier.

# FYI: 
echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
chsh -s /bin/bash

# change shell for a particular user
chsh -s /bin/bash vivek

# change shell for root user
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash
