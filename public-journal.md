## **Why you should do **nothing** before 1.5 hours of sleeping?

Its necessary to do literally nothing but focus on trying to sleeping in the last 1.5 hours of the day i.e., you need to prepare yourself to sleep. Lets take an example that what could be the other way.., consider you want yourself to woke up at 6am and thus you'll prepare yourself to sleep @ 10pm. And it sound pretty simple, but the problem is that you cannot go to bed @ 10 pm and expect your body to just switch off. The reson is your body needs a relaxed state of mind to sleep and it needs you to do nothing for a span of time i.e., around 1hr and can be even longer 1.5hr if you have sleep disturbed patterns already. So that 1hr or 1.5hr is make you body in relaxed state and prepare for the waing up tomorrow morning with a confident mood and mindset.
