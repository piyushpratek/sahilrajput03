- **quickmarks**:

  FYI: To add a quickmark type command `:quick` and you'll see below list of commands in suggestions:

  **ALERT: Don't modify the ~/.config/qutebrowser/quickmarks file directly**, coz there's no way of loading that file again in running instace of qutebrowser, **so its better to use qutebrowser itself commands below defined to add/delete any quickmarks.**
  **ALERT:FYI: If you edit the file if you really want to then you can simply close the browser and open it again so it picks up the changes made in file. (also, `config-source` doesn't seem to help with this too).**

  ```
  quickmark-add #To add a new quickmark
  quickmark-del # To delete a quickmark
  quickmark-load name_of_quickmark # To load a quickmark (you can open it in current tab/new tab/new window as well).
  quickmark-save # Save the current page as a quickmark.
