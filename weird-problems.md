Q. Is there a way to screen share and have remote control feature with lowest possible bandwidth using some vector based graphic resolution?

If you have ever used high contrast mode in MS Windows then its very easy to relate what exactly I am asking for?

USE CASE: In India (and many other countries) there is lack of good internet connectivity or people prefer using mobile's internet as hotspot for the desktop which doesn't provide high bandwidth thus causing desktop sharing services fail miserably providing unbearable user experience.

My question is like instead of sending pixels over internet (unlike google meet and zoom calls) to just send vector based screen casting (exactly like svg vs pixel images) and  doing so will improve the desktop sharing experience with low quality internet as well (just the text and a low level detailing of any images/logos only).

I am searching for such solution online but can't find it..., is there any?
